# Safespace
A Flutter application designed to help people with Alzheimer, by always keeping their family close. Conceptually speaking, the "care-taker" would directly connect to a "patient" by scanning a unique QR code. The care-takers would then be able to add tasks to the patient's daily routine, check on their mood, or even add posts to the memory lane.

The project was done in a 24h hackathon, focused on resolving health related issues.
